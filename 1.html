<h2>HTML</h2>
<br>HTML stands for <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" title="w3c">HyperText Markup Language</a>. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. 
<br>
HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:

<p style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"><strong>Web development.</strong> Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
<br><strong>Internet navigation.</strong> Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
<br><strong>Web documentation.</strong> HTML makes it possible to <u>organize and format documents</u>, similarly to Microsoft Word.
It’s also worth noting that HTML is <u>not</u> considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. It is now considered an official web standard. 
<br>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates.
